# (Herman) Earth Motion Monitor
This program is intended to emulate the appearance of Charles Ammon's Earth Motion Monitor.
Instead of making this a polished macOS or iOS app, this version uses open-source software
packages, including SAC (Seismic Analysis Code), GSAC (General Seismic Analysis Code), and
GMT (Generic Mapping Tools).
